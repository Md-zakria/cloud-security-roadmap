# 📘 Day 1 – Networking Fundamentals

## ✅ Topics Covered:
- What is a network?
- Types of networks: LAN, WAN, PAN
- Common network devices: Router, Switch, Hub, Modem
- Basics of how data moves in a network
- Introduction to OSI and TCP/IP models

## 🧠 Key Points Learned:
- Networks allow communication and data sharing between devices.
- Routers connect different networks; switches connect devices within a network.
- TCP/IP is the real-world protocol stack used on the internet.
- OSI has 7 layers; TCP/IP has 4 layers — both describe how data travels.

## 📝 Notes:
- **TCP/IP Layers**: Application, Transport, Internet, Network Access
- **OSI Layers**: Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data Link, Physical
- TCP uses 3-way handshake for reliable data transmission.
- IP addresses identify devices on a network.
